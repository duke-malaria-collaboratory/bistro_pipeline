# Snakemake pipeline to run [`euroformix`](https://github.com/oyvble/euroformix)

This snakemake pipeline uses functions from the R package [`euroformix`](https://github.com/oyvble/euroformix) to calculate the likelihood that short tandem repeat (STR) profiles of human blood from freshly fed mosquitoes (the "evidence") are from a given person (the "reference"). It outputs a csv with the log10 likelihood ratio (log10LR) for each mosquito-human pair, where the numerator is the likelihood that the person was bitten by the mosquito and the denominator is the likelihood that someone else was bitten by the mosquito. 

There are 3 input csv files that are required to run the pipeline:
1. Human population allele frequencies.
1. Human STR profiles (the "reference").
1. Mosquito STR profiles (the "evidence").

The output is a dataframe of log10LRs for each mosquito-human pair.

## Data requirements

Formats for each dataset required for this pipeline are shown below.

### Human population allele frequency

Population frequencies for each allele at each locus should be supplied in a .csv file with one column for each STR marker and one row for each allele. The alleles should be listed in a column titled "Allele". The first two rows of an example table with the loci from the Promega Geneprint10 kit is shown below:

| Allele | TH01 | D21S11 | D5S818 | D13S317 | D7S820 | D16S539 | CSF1PO | AMEL | vWA | TPOX |
|:------:|:----:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:----:|:---:|:----:|:---:|
|6|0.206957| | | | | | | | |0.098276|
|8|0.250435| |0.06117|0.021053|0.187716|0.033304|0.042205| | |0.24569|


### Human STR profiles (the "reference")

The human reference STR profiles should be supplied in a .csv file with one row per STR marker for each person. The column headings should be formmated as shown in the example rows below:

|SampleName|Marker|Allele1|Allele2|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Person_1|TH01|6|8|
|Person_1|D21S11|29|30|


### Mosquito STR profiles (the "evidence")

The mosquito STR profiles (evidence samples) should be supplied in a .csv file with one rwo per STR marker for each sample. The column headings should be formatted as shown in the example rows below:

|SampleName|Marker|Allele1|Allele2|Allele3|Allele4|...|Height1|Height2|Height3|Height4|...|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Sample_1|TH01|6|8|9| | |4887|4662|9104| | |
|Sample_1|D21S11|27|28|30| | |4402|8325|2181| | |


## Installing euroformix

First, [download miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for linux if you don't already have it:
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

Next, run these commands to download and install the pipeline and the euroformix R package (you only have to do all this once):
```
git clone https://github.com/duke-malaria-collaboratory/run_euroformix.git # download this GitHub repository
cd run_euroformix # move into the run_euroformix directory
mamba env create -f config/environment/euroformix.yaml # create the euroformix conda environment
conda activate euroformix # activate the euroformix conda environment
Rscript -e "devtools::install_github('https://github.com/oyvble/euroformix.git')" # install euroformix in environment
```

Note that you will have to activate the conda environment each time you open a new terminal:
```
conda activate euroformix
```

## Using the euroformix snakemake pipeline

To run the pipeline on the cluster, you have to modify the following files:
- `scripts/submit_slurm.sbat` (email address)
- `config/slurm/cluster.yaml` (email address)
- `config/config.yaml` (paths to input data; other parameters if you want)

To check to see if everything is working okay, first do a "dry-run":
```
conda activate euroformix # be sure you've activated the environment! 
snakemake -n # dry-run
```

If this runs successfully, then run:
```
sbatch scripts/submit_slurm.sbat # submit the job to the cluster
```

See below for more information on snakemake.

## Output files

The main output is a csv file containing the log10LR for each mosquito-human pair. By default, this output is stored in `output/log10LRs.csv`. 

Intermediate data files generated by the pipeline are stored in `output/data`. These include formatted input files and rds files with the data shaped in the format required for `euroformix`. 


## Learning more about snakemake

Benefits of snakemake
- Your analysis is reproducible.
- You don't have to re-perform computationally intensive tasks early in the pipeline to change downstream analyses or figures.
- You can easily combine shell, R, Python, etc. scritps into one pipeline.
- You can easily share your pipeline with others.
- You can submit a single slurm job and snakemake handles submitting the rest of your jobs for you.
